# MAH-Portfolio-HW2
Personal Portfolio and Code Repository for HW2

  In this Homework Assignment, I created a portfolio page that I will update throughout the course of the Bootcamp. The criteria for the portfolio included having a functional `<nav> ` element that, upon being clicked, would scroll to the corresponding about me, contact, and published works section of the page. With user accesibility once again at the forefront of developing this web application, I used flexbox to create an accessible mobile application for users with sight impairments. In mobile mode, the website flexes and contours to fit the size of the screen within the specified range of pixels. 

The important skills cultivated in the course include flexbox, media queries, relative linking, semantic HTML, and all criteria from HW1 assignment of and relating to search engine optimization. Below I have included the link to the deployed application and the a link to this GitHub repository.
