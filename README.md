# MAH-Portfolio-HW2
Malik's Personal Portfolio


In this repository, I have brought my portfolio up to date (07/19/2022) with all of my best work thus far. The current strengths of my personal portfolio highlight the use of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, as well as node.js packages.

 In updating my website content, I ensured the usage of functional elements, such as the `<nav> ` element that, upon being clicked, navigate the user to the corresponding sections of the page. With user accesibility once again at the forefront of developing this web application, I used flexbox to create an accessible mobile application for users with sight impairments. In mobile mode, the website flexes and contours to fit the size of the screen within the specified range of pixels. 

The important skills cultivated in the building of this page are further exemplified in the highlighted assignments contained in the portfolio section.
